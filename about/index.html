                <p>NEPALGUNJ: The coronavirus test lab established at the Bheri Zonal Hospital, Nepalgunj has faced a shortage of Viral Transport Medium (VTM).
                    VTM contains antifungal and antibiotic supplements, used in the viral test. 
                    The VTM is required for testing swab of suspected patients but the lab is facing a shortage of it, said the officiating chief of the hospital Dr. Prakash Thapa.
                    Thapa added that they were continuing testing via PCR only for extremely needed cases due to a lack of VTM to test from other methods of the suspect ones.  
                    Thapa further shared that request has been made for additional VTM from State and central level but it is yet to be received.
